# A Number Walks Into a Base...
print(0b10 + 0o10 + 0x10)
"""
Python allows us to write integers in different bases using specific prefixes: 0b for binary, 0o for octal, and 0x for hexadecimal. In the given code, we are adding three such numbers:
0b10 is binary for 2
0o10 is octal for 8
0x10 is hexadecimal for 16
Putting it all together, the expression becomes 2 + 8 + 16, which equals 26
